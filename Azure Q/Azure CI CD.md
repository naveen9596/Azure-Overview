### **Real-Time Use Case: CI/CD for an E-Commerce Web Application on Azure**  

#### **Scenario:**  
An e-commerce company wants to implement a **CI/CD pipeline on Azure** for their web application. The goal is to automate the build, test, and deployment process using **Azure DevOps**, ensuring that new features, bug fixes, and security updates are deployed efficiently and with minimal downtime.

---

### **Architecture & Tools Used:**
- **Source Code Repository:** Azure Repos (Git)
- **Build & Release Pipeline:** Azure Pipelines
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform/ARM Templates
- **Security & Compliance:** Azure Key Vault, Azure Monitor
- **Testing Frameworks:** Selenium, JUnit, Postman

---

### **CI/CD Pipeline Workflow:**
#### **1. Code Commit & Source Control (CI)**
- Developers push code changes to **Azure Repos (Git)**.
- A **pull request (PR)** is created and reviewed using Azure DevOps.
- Once approved, the code is merged into the `main` or `dev` branch.

#### **2. Continuous Integration (CI) - Build & Test**
- The Azure **CI Pipeline** is triggered automatically when code is pushed.
- Steps involved:
  - **Code Build**: Uses Azure DevOps **YAML pipeline** or **classic editor** to run `dotnet build` (for .NET apps) or `npm build` (for Node.js apps).
  - **Unit Testing**: Runs JUnit/NUnit for backend testing.
  - **Security Scanning**: SonarQube or WhiteSource for code security vulnerabilities.
  - **Containerization**: Builds a Docker image and pushes it to **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.
  - **Artifact Storage**: Non-container artifacts (like `.zip` files) are stored in **Azure Artifacts**.

#### **3. Continuous Deployment (CD) - Staging Environment**
- The **CD Pipeline** is triggered after a successful build.
- Steps involved:
  - **Infrastructure Deployment**: Uses Terraform or ARM templates to provision resources.
  - **Application Deployment**:
    - If it's a web app, deploys to **Azure App Service**.
    - If containerized, deploys to **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.
  - **Integration Testing**: Runs Selenium/Postman tests.
  - **Approval Process**: Manual or automated approval before moving to production.

#### **4. Production Deployment (Blue-Green or Canary Deployment)**
- Once testing is successful, deployment to **Production** happens with:
  - **Blue-Green Deployment**: Deploys to a new environment, then switches traffic.
  - **Canary Deployment**: Gradually rolls out changes to a small percentage of users before full deployment.
  - **Feature Flags**: Uses Azure App Configuration for controlled feature rollouts.

#### **5. Monitoring & Feedback Loop**
- **Azure Monitor & Application Insights**: Tracks errors, logs, and performance.
- **Azure Security Center**: Monitors security vulnerabilities.
- **Rollback Strategy**: If an issue is detected, the pipeline triggers an automatic rollback.

### **Business Benefits:**
âœ… Faster time to market with automated releases  
âœ… Reduced deployment risks with automated testing  
âœ… Improved security with compliance checks  
âœ… High availability with zero-downtime deployments
