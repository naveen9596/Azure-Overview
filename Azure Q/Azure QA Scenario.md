### Beginner Level
1. **Scenario**: Your organization is planning to host a web application on Azure with minimal cost. You need to deploy a small-scale application with infrequent usage.  
   **Question**: Which Azure compute service would you choose for this deployment, and why?  
   **Answer**: Azure App Service (for web apps) or Azure Functions (serverless architecture for event-driven workloads). These are cost-effective for infrequent usage.

2. **Scenario**: Your team needs to deploy a virtual machine in Azure to test a new software application. The team has requested both Windows and Linux VMs.  
   **Question**: How would you set up these virtual machines, and what considerations are needed for pricing and OS licensing?  
   **Answer**: Use the Azure Portal or Azure CLI to create Windows and Linux VMs. Consider the OS licensing costs included in the Windows VM pricing and the pay-as-you-go model.

### Intermediate Level
3. **Scenario**: The IT security team has requested that sensitive data stored in an Azure Storage account be encrypted to meet compliance requirements.  
   **Question**: How would you ensure the data stored in Azure Storage is encrypted, and what encryption types are available?  
   **Answer**: Azure Storage automatically encrypts data at rest using Microsoft-managed keys (default). For more control, use customer-managed keys stored in Azure Key Vault.

4. **Scenario**: Your team is deploying a new application and wants to ensure high availability with minimal downtime in case of regional failures.  
   **Question**: Which Azure services and configurations would you implement to achieve this?  
   **Answer**: Use Azure Traffic Manager for geographic load balancing, paired with an active-active or active-passive setup in multiple Azure regions.

### Advanced Level
5. **Scenario**: You are responsible for setting up a DevOps pipeline in Azure DevOps for your application. The pipeline must deploy code to an Azure App Service and notify the team if the deployment fails.  
   **Question**: How would you configure this pipeline to meet the requirements?  
   **Answer**: Set up an Azure DevOps pipeline with build and release stages. Integrate Azure App Service for deployment and configure failure alerts using Azure Monitor or a webhook to notify the team.

6. **Scenario**: Your organization is moving its on-premises SQL database to Azure. The database must remain accessible during migration with minimal downtime.  
   **Question**: Which Azure service would you use, and how would you perform the migration?  
   **Answer**: Use Azure Database Migration Service to migrate the on-premises SQL database to Azure SQL Database with minimal downtime through online migration.

### Case Study-Based
7. **Scenario**: A company uses on-premises infrastructure but wants to implement a hybrid solution to extend their data center to Azure for scaling during peak demand.  
   **Question**: Which Azure service would you recommend, and how would you configure it?  
   **Answer**: Use Azure Arc to manage on-premises and cloud resources uniformly, or set up an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and a Site-to-Site VPN to extend the data center to Azure.

8. **Scenario**: A new project requires storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as log files and media content. The team needs cost-effective storage with access through REST APIs.  
   **Question**: Which Azure storage solution would you recommend, and why?  
   **Answer**: Use Azure Blob Storage, as it is cost-effective for unstructured data and accessible through REST APIs.
